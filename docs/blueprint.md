- Brew Method Sections: Separate pages or sub-sections for different brewing methods (Espresso, Pour-over, AeroPress, etc.) with method-specific notes.
- Flavor Logbook: Dedicated pages for individual coffee origins/roasts to record blind tastings and compare notes.
- Skills Tracker: Track progress on grind dosing, espresso dialing, milk steaming, workflow efficiency, and customer-style service with visual aids.
- Weekly Summary: Weekly reflection and summary with improved things, things still struggling with, new brews/beans, goals for the next week

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Rich coffee brown (#6F4E37) to evoke a sense of warmth and the essence of coffee.
- Background color: Light beige (#F5F5DC) to provide a neutral, parchment-like canvas.
- Accent color: Warm orange (#D2691E), approximately 30 degrees 'left' of brown on the color wheel, to highlight key actions.
- Font pairing: 'Belleza' (sans-serif) for headlines and short chunks of text, 'Alegreya' (serif) for longer text passages. Consider monospace fonts reminiscent of old typewriters for data entry fields.
- Use minimalist, line-based icons related to coffee brewing and tasting notes. For instance, a coffee bean for the bean origin section, a water drop for water details, a gear for equipment, etc. All icons should have a slightly aged or distressed appearance.
- Organize the journal entries into clear, distinct sections. Use whitespace effectively to separate sections and make the content easy to scan. Consider a card-based layout for brew methods and flavor logs. The layout should adapt fluidly to different screen sizes for optimal mobile viewing.
- Use subtle animations like fading effects when transitioning between sections or when saving an entry. Avoid distracting animations. Transitions should be quick and responsive, ensuring a smooth experience on mobile devices.
